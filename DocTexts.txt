-- Albanians - Two countries home none
00:40 -> 00:48 | As I was growing up, I realized that there was no hope to start a family, a home
01:25 -> 01:32 | We decorated with my wife our first Christmas tree, we celebrated Christmas for the first time, New Year's Eve
02:10 -> 02:30 | I have a friend who is a painter and he asked me "Do you know how to read?" "Yes" I said. He gave me to read the Odyssey, he found some programs for me, I attended the lessons, I gave the exams and I got a certificate on Greek language
02:50 -> 03:05 | When I'm here, I miss my country and I want to go there, but when I go I ask myself "What am I doing here?"
03:05 -> 03:10 | This generation of migrants has nowhere to stand. We have two countries, but in the end neither is our motherland
03:23 -> 03:32 | <<Epirus Song>>
03:42 -> 03:48 | Even in the thought of leaving, my heart breaks, I don't want this
04:09 -> 04:16 | I might not have Greek parents, but I am half Greek
04:23 -> 04:32 | Greek is not he who was born in Greece, but he who educates himself by the history and the culture of Greece

-- Egyptians - Remaining silent ensures your living
00:10 -> 00:26 | <<Seagulls>>
01:01 -> 01:08 | In the name of the God, most Gracious, most Compassionate, I left Egypt and I came to Greece to work as a fisherman
01:47 -> 01:55 | Normally, in a job, you have a fixed number of working hours. We do not, as the sea has no time schedule
03:42 -> 03:46 | You only have a few hours to rest
03:58 -> 04:25 | <<People eating, talking a bit>>
04:46 -> 04:59 | Our salaries are not enough to cover even our monthly expenses. Not to mention our pensions, or the money left to be sent back home, for example when I am away for a year, or eight months
05:16 -> 05:25 | This is not a clean business. Fishery thrives in dearkness. If you refuse the money they give you, or ask for more, you' re out
05:27 -> 05:32 | If you react, you' re out. Remaining silent ensures your living
06:00 -> 02:12 | <<Seagulls, wind>>

-- Indians - For a better life
00:45 -> 00:48 | When I came here, I lived entirely different things
00:54 -> 00:56 | What brings us here?
01:05 -> 01:15 | They have foreign friends, they take pictures, they go outside for parties, every -- I was really excited for that life
01:22 -> 01:30 | I have been in many universities here in Greece, but it's just too much money, around 16,000 I guess
02:20 -> 02:30 | Many Indians, like around 20 to 25,000 Indians are living here in Greece. They don't speak greek, they cannot renew their documents
02:30 -> 02:37 | In our language, we say 'mithi jail', it's a kind of sweet prison you want to leave, but you cannot leave it
02:37 -> 02:41 | We always have a problem with the word for foreigners "black"
03:12 -> 03:23 | Now I learnt that, being a foreigner is not to speak anything about somebody, be quiet, do you own work. This is the life
03:30 -> 03:43 | I always want greek friends. Our neighbours are good, when we see them out we only say hello to each other, but not too close to go to each other's homes
03:52 -> 04:05 | Like, we have a dispute between India and Pakistan, but here everybody is living together. We have Pakistani frineds, we have Albanian friends, we have Bangladeshi friends
04:05 -> 04:14 | We start learning about their cultures, cultural activities, what they do, what they like, what they eat, how do they live, what languages they speak
04:14 -> 04:20 | So these are the things we learn only if we left our motherlands
04:49 -> 05:08 | Since 2009 Greece is facing some crisis. Now I'm planning to leave Greece, because I wanted to live with my family. Also, now in India, everybody is working, we have more jobs... Oportunity is there now


-- Nigerians - Bridges of culture
00:10 -> 00:35 | <<Drums>>
01:54 -> 02:02 | And suddenly, you are in a position to give explanations to people, like "You know something? Not all people are like that"
02:03 -> 02:41 | <<Drums lesson>>
03:08 -> 03:12 | A place to dream about a better place
03:24 -> 03:29 | Nigeria has created inside me the urge to try to find about my roots

-- Ukranians - Teaching from within
00:46 -> 01:02 | In Ukraine I was working as a teacher. I graduated from the Faculty of Education, I got my Ph. D there. I was a school teacher, teaching kids at the elementary
01:45 -> 01:50 | Since there is no work, I read books
01:58 -> 02:06 | I prepare my class at the store
02:46 -> 03:01 | When I was in Ukraine, I could not imagine that one day I would be selling clothes in a childrens' store... or in any store, that is completely irrelevant with my education
03:18 -> 03:32 | Now that I can teach Ukrainian at school every Saturday, I am so happy, I can't tell you how happy I am
03:54 -> 04:08 | Of course, all the kids speak Greek. Most of them were born here, some came here at a very small age, that is why they speak better Greek than Ukrainian
04:08 -> 04:33 | <<Classroom>>
06:18 -> 06:25 | Some kids return to Ukraine to visit their grandparents, other children have no family there, they can't visit for this reason
06:30 -> 06:55 | <<Children singing Ukrainian>>
